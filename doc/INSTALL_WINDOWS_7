# Description: Notes on installing elastic file server on windows as a Windows Service and running using the Thin Ruby on Rails server



# Install Elastic

  Open Git Bash and go to your preferred Elastic folder.
  
  This install assumes you'll install it in c:\code\elastic

    cd c:

    mkdir code

    cd code

    git clone git://github.com/remomueller/elastic.git

  Type 'yes' if it asks you to add the RSA key fingerprint.

    cd elastic

  Install required gems

    bundle install
    
  Run Initial Setup to Stage remaining required files

    cd lib

    ruby initial_setup.rb

    cd ..

  Type possibly bundle exec rake db:migrate

    cd c:\code\elastic

    rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production


# How to startup server in case the service approach does not work or for initial testing.

  thin start -p [my_port_number] -e production

# Create the empty service placeholder

  C:\Program Files\Windows Resource Kits\Tools> instsrv "[my_service_name]" "c:\program files\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\srvany.exe"

# Create Parameters folder under the [my_service_name] Registry key
# Use regedit.  WARNING! Remember to back your registry before making changes.
# INCORRECT EDITS CAN CAUSE YOUR COMPUTER TO STOP FUNCTIONING!

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\[my_service_name]\Parameters

# Add the following keys to the Parameters folder:
  [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\[my_service_name]\Parameters]

  Application=c:\Ruby192\bin\ruby.exe
  AppDirectory=c:\code\elastic
  AppParameters=c:\Ruby192\bin\thin start -p [my_port_number] -e production
  
# Remember to set your service to autorestart
# In Services Panel->[my_service_name]->Properties->General, set:
  Startup type: Automatic
  
# In Services Panel->[my_service_name]->Properties->Recovery, set:
  First failure: Restart the Service
  Second failure: Restart the Service
  Subsequent failures: Restart the Service
  
# In Services Panel->[my_service_name]->Properties->Log On, set:
  Log on as: Local System account

# You can now startup your server by either restarting Windows or clicking Start on [my_service_name]
# Note: The server startup may not appear to start immediately as it loads in the background.
# Give it about 2 minutes (min) to 5 minutes (max) to start up. And navigate your browser to:
  http://localhost:[my_port_number]/
